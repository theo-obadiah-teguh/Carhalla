# Project Milestones

This subdirectory contains the PDF format submissions that are required throughout the duration and length of our project. All the included files assist us in pacing our project and also track our progress in a systematic way. There are five set milestones throughout the project.

- Milestone 1: Project Proposal, Conceptual Design, ER Diagram
- Milestone 2: Logical Design, RS, SQL DDL, Normalization, Query Design
- Milestone 3: Project Check In
- Milestone 4: Project Implementation
- Milestone 5: Group Demonstration

We have organized everything in this folder for the convenience of the teaching team.
